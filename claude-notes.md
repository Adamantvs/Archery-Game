  - Large menacing body with dark red metallic materials and emissive effects
  - Massive animated wings with realistic bone structure and flapping motion
  - Glowing red eyes and fearsome horns
  - Sharp teeth arranged in circular pattern around the mouth
  - Detailed tail with spikes and claws with sharp talons

- ✅ Dragon awards 10 bonus score points when defeated
- ✅ Added dramatic UI warning when dragon spawns with pulsing red notification

## Dragon Boss Features
- Spawns at position [0, 15, -60] after killing 5 enemies
- Health: 5 hits to defeat
- Movement: Circles around castle at radius 25 with vertical bobbing
- Visual: Massive dark red dragon with glowing effects and health bar
- Rewards: 10 score points when defeated
- UI: Dramatic spawn notification and health tracking

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
