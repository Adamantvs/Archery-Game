## Current Task
Dragon Boss Final Boss System - Enhanced with User Feedback

## Progress - Dragon Boss Implementation
- ✅ Added kill counter tracking system to monitor enemy defeats
- ✅ Implemented dragon spawn logic that triggers after 5 enemy kills
- ✅ Created massive DragonBoss component with detailed 3D model:
  - Large menacing body with dark red metallic materials and emissive effects
  - Massive animated wings with realistic bone structure and flapping motion
  - Glowing red eyes and fearsome horns
  - Sharp teeth arranged in circular pattern around the mouth
  - Detailed tail with spikes and claws with sharp talons
  - Health indicator UI showing 5/5 health above dragon
- ✅ Implemented dragon AI with circling movement pattern around castle
- ✅ Added dragon collision detection with 2.0 unit hit radius for arrows
- ✅ Dragon takes 5 hits to defeat, with explosion effects on each hit
- ✅ Dragon awards 10 bonus score points when defeated
- ✅ Added dramatic UI warning when dragon spawns with pulsing red notification
- ✅ Updated game instructions to show dragon boss unlock requirement
- ✅ Integrated dragon state management with parent component state

## Dragon Boss Features - Enhanced
- Spawns at position [0, 15, -60] after killing 5 enemies
- Health: 5 hits to defeat
- Movement: Circles around castle at radius 25 with vertical bobbing
- Visual: Massive dark red dragon with glowing effects and health bar
- Rewards: 10 score points when defeated
- UI: Dramatic spawn notification at top (disappears after 4 seconds)
- Win Condition: Defeating dragon (not 10 enemies) triggers victory
- Environmental: Sky becomes redder and more ominous when dragon appears
- UI Updates: Score shows enemy kill count (5/5), updated instructions

## Latest Enhancements
- ✅ Changed win condition from 10 enemy kills to dragon defeat only
- ✅ Moved dragon warning popup to top of screen instead of center
- ✅ Made dragon warning temporary (4-second display then disappears)
- ✅ Added menacing red sky effect when dragon appears (lower sun, higher turbidity)
- ✅ Updated UI to show enemy kill progress (5/5) instead of total score target
- ✅ Added clear win instruction: "Defeat the dragon to WIN!"
- ✅ Fixed sky to be blue with clouds before dragon (reduced turbidity from 10 to 2)

## Dragon Death Enhancements
- ✅ Made dragon death dramatically more spectacular with multiple explosions
- ✅ All enemies die simultaneously when dragon is defeated (staggered visual effect)
- ✅ Added small victory popup that appears immediately after dragon death
- ✅ Full victory screen appears 3 seconds later for better pacing
- ✅ 5 massive explosions surround the dragon during death sequence
- ✅ All active enemies get killed with dramatic pop effects when dragon dies

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
