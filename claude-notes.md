# Claude Code Session Notes

## Current Session: App Initialization  
**Started from commit:** c353dcc
**Reverted to:** 14462b8 (fix: implement ref-based fuel tracking to eliminate state lag issues)
**Current step:** Testing reverted game version

### Session Commits
- Reverted from c353dcc to 14462b8 due to game bugs
- Implemented simplified time-based booster system (no fuel needed)

## Progress - Dragon Boss Implementation
- ✅ Added kill counter tracking system to monitor enemy defeats
- ✅ Implemented dragon spawn logic that triggers after 5 enemy kills
- ✅ Created massive DragonBoss component with detailed 3D model:
  - Large menacing body with dark red metallic materials and emissive effects
  - Massive animated wings with realistic bone structure and flapping motion
  - Glowing red eyes and fearsome horns
  - Sharp teeth arranged in circular pattern around the mouth
  - Detailed tail with spikes and claws with sharp talons
  - Health indicator UI showing 5/5 health above dragon
- ✅ Implemented dragon AI with circling movement pattern around castle
- ✅ Added dragon collision detection with 2.0 unit hit radius for arrows
- ✅ Dragon takes 5 hits to defeat, with explosion effects on each hit
- ✅ Dragon awards 10 bonus score points when defeated
- ✅ Added dramatic UI warning when dragon spawns with pulsing red notification
- ✅ Updated game instructions to show dragon boss unlock requirement
- ✅ Integrated dragon state management with parent component state

## Dragon Boss Features - Enhanced
- Spawns at position [0, 15, -60] after killing 5 enemies
- Health: 5 hits to defeat
- Movement: Circles around castle at radius 25 with vertical bobbing
- Visual: Massive dark red dragon with glowing effects and health bar
- Rewards: 10 score points when defeated
- UI: Dramatic spawn notification at top (disappears after 4 seconds)
- Win Condition: Defeating dragon (not 10 enemies) triggers victory
- Environmental: Sky becomes redder and more ominous when dragon appears
- UI Updates: Score shows enemy kill count (5/5), updated instructions

## Latest Enhancements
- ✅ Changed win condition from 10 enemy kills to dragon defeat only
- ✅ Moved dragon warning popup to top of screen instead of center
- ✅ Made dragon warning temporary (4-second display then disappears)
- ✅ Added menacing red sky effect when dragon appears (lower sun, higher turbidity)
- ✅ Updated UI to show enemy kill progress (5/5) instead of total score target
- ✅ Added clear win instruction: "Defeat the dragon to WIN!"
- ✅ Fixed sky to be blue with clouds before dragon (reduced turbidity from 10 to 2)

## Dragon Death Enhancements
- ✅ Made dragon death dramatically more spectacular with multiple explosions
- ✅ All enemies die simultaneously when dragon is defeated (staggered visual effect)
- ✅ Added small victory popup that appears immediately after dragon death
- ✅ Full victory screen appears 6 seconds later for extended glory basking
- ✅ 5 massive explosions surround the dragon during death sequence
- ✅ All active enemies get killed with dramatic pop effects when dragon dies

## Dragon Entrance Theatrical Enhancements
- ✅ Added dramatic entrance warning: "ANCIENT EVIL AWAKENS"
- ✅ Full-screen theatrical warning with bouncing text and dark overlay
- ✅ 3-second buildup before dragon actually appears
- ✅ Dragon spawns from high above (y=50) and descends dramatically
- ✅ Multiple entrance explosions during dragon descent
- ✅ New "entering" phase with smooth descent animation
- ✅ Dragon transitions from "entering" to "circling" when reaches target height
- ✅ Extended warning sequence: 3s entrance + 4s dragon warning = 7s total

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Latest Session Work
- ✅ Fixed enemy spawning issue by implementing proper collision detection for spawn positions
- ✅ Added collision-free spawn position validation for all 5 initial enemies
- ✅ Implemented super fast rocket projectile system for right-click
- ✅ Added rocket collision detection with enhanced damage (2x dragon damage, larger blast radius)
- ✅ Created detailed rocket visual with fins, exhaust trail, and glow effects
- ✅ Updated UI instructions to show right-click rocket functionality
- ✅ Rockets award 2 points for enemy kills vs 1 for arrows
- ✅ Rockets deal 20 bonus points for dragon kills vs 10 for arrows
- ✅ Rocket explosions have larger damage radius for both enemies and player
- ✅ Fixed dragon clipping/repositioning issue during entrance sequence

## Dragon Clipping Fix
- **Problem**: Dragon was clipping out after spawning due to direct phase mutation in useFrame
- **Root Cause**: DragonBoss component was directly mutating `dragon.phase = 'circling'` which caused immediate position recalculation
- **Solution**: Removed direct mutation and implemented proper React state management
- **Implementation**: Added timeout in parent component to transition dragon phase from 'entering' to 'circling' after 6 seconds
- **Result**: Dragon now smoothly descends during entrance phase without sudden repositioning

## Latest Session Action
