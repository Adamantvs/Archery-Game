- ✅ Implemented dragon spawn logic that triggers after 5 enemy kills
- ✅ Created massive DragonBoss component with detailed 3D model:
  - Large menacing body with dark red metallic materials and emissive effects
  - Massive animated wings with realistic bone structure and flapping motion
  - Glowing red eyes and fearsome horns
  - Sharp teeth arranged in circular pattern around the mouth
  - Detailed tail with spikes and claws with sharp talons
  - Health indicator UI showing 5/5 health above dragon
- ✅ Implemented dragon AI with circling movement pattern around castle
- ✅ Added dragon collision detection with 2.0 unit hit radius for arrows
- ✅ Dragon takes 5 hits to defeat, with explosion effects on each hit
- ✅ Dragon awards 10 bonus score points when defeated
- ✅ Added dramatic UI warning when dragon spawns with pulsing red notification
- ✅ Updated game instructions to show dragon boss unlock requirement

## Dragon Boss Features - Enhanced
- Spawns at position [0, 15, -60] after killing 5 enemies
- Health: 5 hits to defeat
- Movement: Circles around castle at radius 25 with vertical bobbing
- Visual: Massive dark red dragon with glowing effects and health bar
- Rewards: 10 score points when defeated
- UI: Dramatic spawn notification at top (disappears after 4 seconds)
- Win Condition: Defeating dragon (not 10 enemies) triggers victory
- Environmental: Sky becomes redder and more ominous when dragon appears
- UI Updates: Score shows enemy kill count (5/5), updated instructions

## Latest Enhancements
- ✅ Changed win condition from 10 enemy kills to dragon defeat only
- ✅ Moved dragon warning popup to top of screen instead of center
- ✅ Made dragon warning temporary (4-second display then disappears)
- ✅ Added menacing red sky effect when dragon appears (lower sun, higher turbidity)
- ✅ Updated UI to show enemy kill progress (5/5) instead of total score target
- ✅ Added clear win instruction: "Defeat the dragon to WIN!"
- ✅ Fixed sky to be blue with clouds before dragon (reduced turbidity from 10 to 2)

## Dragon Death Enhancements
- ✅ Made dragon death dramatically more spectacular with multiple explosions
- ✅ All enemies die simultaneously when dragon is defeated (staggered visual effect)
- ✅ Added small victory popup that appears immediately after dragon death
- ✅ Full victory screen appears 6 seconds later for extended glory basking
- ✅ 5 massive explosions surround the dragon during death sequence
- ✅ All active enemies get killed with dramatic pop effects when dragon dies

## Dragon Entrance Theatrical Enhancements
- ✅ Added dramatic entrance warning: "ANCIENT EVIL AWAKENS"
- ✅ Full-screen theatrical warning with bouncing text and dark overlay
- ✅ 3-second buildup before dragon actually appears
- ✅ Dragon spawns from high above (y=50) and descends dramatically
- ✅ Multiple entrance explosions during dragon descent
- ✅ New "entering" phase with smooth descent animation
- ✅ Dragon transitions from "entering" to "circling" when reaches target height
- ✅ Extended warning sequence: 3s entrance + 4s dragon warning = 7s total

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Latest Session Work
- ✅ Fixed enemy spawning issue by implementing proper collision detection for spawn positions
- ✅ Added collision-free spawn position validation for all 5 initial enemies
- ✅ Implemented super fast rocket projectile system for right-click
- ✅ Added rocket collision detection with enhanced damage (2x dragon damage, larger blast radius)
- ✅ Created detailed rocket visual with fins, exhaust trail, and glow effects
- ✅ Updated UI instructions to show right-click rocket functionality
- ✅ Rockets award 2 points for enemy kills vs 1 for arrows
- ✅ Rockets deal 20 bonus points for dragon kills vs 10 for arrows
- ✅ Rocket explosions have larger damage radius for both enemies and player
- ✅ Fixed dragon clipping/repositioning issue during entrance sequence

## Dragon Clipping Fix
- **Problem**: Dragon was clipping out after spawning due to direct phase mutation in useFrame
- **Root Cause**: DragonBoss component was directly mutating `dragon.phase = 'circling'` which caused immediate position recalculation
- **Solution**: Removed direct mutation and implemented proper React state management
- **Implementation**: Added timeout in parent component to transition dragon phase from 'entering' to 'circling' after 6 seconds
- **Result**: Dragon now smoothly descends during entrance phase without sudden repositioning

## Latest Session Action
- ✅ **Fixed Dragon Crash Issue**: Reduced simultaneous explosions from 7 to 4 with staggered timing to prevent performance overload
- ✅ **Optimized Explosion Cleanup**: Reduced explosion duration from 2s to 1.5s and increased cleanup frequency from 500ms to 250ms
- ✅ **Redesigned Crossbow**: Added proper bow limbs with realistic curved design, wood texture, and metal reinforcements
- ✅ **Enhanced Bowstring**: Updated string to properly connect limb tips with realistic appearance and serving area
- ✅ **Performance Improvements**: Staggered dragon death explosions with 300ms delays to prevent render overload
- ✅ **Massive Castle Enhancement**: Completely redesigned castle with detailed architecture and medieval authenticity

## Enhanced Castle Features
- **Multi-layered Design**: Foundation base, main keep with tapered design, and 4 corner towers
- **Detailed Battlements**: Proper crenellations on all towers and walls with realistic positioning
- **Architectural Elements**: Stone foundation, wooden gate with metal reinforcements, arched gateway
- **Decorative Features**: Royal flag, colored banners (purple & blue), torch holders with glowing flames
- **Realistic Materials**: Varied stone textures, dark red roofing, golden flagpole, wood and metal gate
- **Windows & Details**: Strategic window placement, multiple tower levels, proper medieval proportions
- **Complete Wall System**: Four walls connecting corner towers with continuous battlements

## Dragon Death Animation Features
- **Falling Physics**: Dragon falls with gravity (speed 12) when health reaches 0
- **Dramatic Rotation**: Dragon spins on all axes while falling for cinematic effect
- **Particle Effects**: Smoke trail and fire particles follow the falling dragon
- **Phase Management**: Added 'dying' phase instead of immediately removing dragon
- **Timing**: 4-second falling animation before victory screen appears
- **Visual Polish**: Health bar hidden during death, dramatic particle effects
- ✅ Created distant mountain range around game perimeter

## Mountain Range Features
- **24 primary mountains** positioned in ring around game area at 120+ unit distance
- **Variable heights**: 15-40 units tall for realistic mountain range silhouette
- **Random positioning**: Slight radius variation to avoid perfect circle pattern
- **Smaller secondary peaks**: 30% chance for additional smaller mountains near main peaks
- **Snow-capped peaks**: Every 4th mountain gets white snow cap for visual variety
- **Mountain colors**: Mix of grays (#555555-#666666) for depth and realism
- **Cone geometry**: 6-sided cones for angular mountain appearance

## Enhanced Dragon Death Sequence
- ✅ **Slow Motion Fall**: Reduced fall speed from 12 to 4 units/sec for dramatic effect
- ✅ **Slow Motion Rotation**: Reduced rotation speeds by 50% for cinematic feel
- ✅ **Ground Impact Detection**: Dragon stops at y=2 and triggers ground explosion
- ✅ **Massive Ground Explosion**: 7 explosions (1 main + 6 scattered) when dragon hits ground
- ✅ **Extended Timing**: Victory screen appears 2 seconds after ground impact (vs immediate)
- ✅ **Dramatic Sequence**: Fall → Ground Impact → Explosions → Victory (much more cinematic)

## Dragon Animation Refinements
- ✅ **Removed Dramatic Entrance Warning**: Eliminated full-screen "ANCIENT EVIL AWAKENS" message
- ✅ **Kept Subtle Warning**: Maintained top banner "DRAGON BOSS AWAKENED" message
- ✅ **Simplified Timing**: Dragon spawns immediately with 4s warning, 3s descent timing
- ✅ **Fixed Dragon Structure**: Reduced rotation speeds during fall to prevent "falling apart" effect
- ✅ **Stable Fall**: Reduced wobble from 1-2 units to 0.2-0.3 units for smooth descent
- ✅ **Gentle Tumbling**: Rotation speeds reduced by ~60% for natural fall without chaos

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
