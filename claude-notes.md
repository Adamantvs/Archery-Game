# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Status
**Current Step**: Archery Game Enhancement
**Starting Commit**: e87469a (feat: enhance archery game with wandering enemies and sprint)

## Session Commits
- 2b16e98 feat: increase enemy wandering radius around castle

## Current Task
Enhanced enemy wandering behavior in archery game.

## Progress
- Increased enemy wandering radius around castle from ±10 to ±25 on X-axis and ±7.5 to ±20 on Z-axis
- Enemies now roam over a much larger area making gameplay more dynamic
- Completed requested enhancement

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
