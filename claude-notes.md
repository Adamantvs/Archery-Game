# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Info
- Start commit: 40428ba (Initial commit)
- Current step: Integrating existing archery game into template
- Working on archery game improvement

## Current Status
Step 1: Requirements Gathering - COMPLETED
- User has existing archery game built with React Three Fiber
- Game features: 3D crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Goal: Integrate and improve the existing game

## Archery Game Analysis
- Built with React Three Fiber, @react-three/drei
- Features: First-person crossbow, arrow physics, bomb targets, explosions
- Environment: Medieval setting with castle, trees, ground
- Controls: WASD movement, mouse aim, click to shoot, spacebar jump
- Physics: Gravity on arrows, collision detection with targets

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Installed React Three Fiber dependencies (three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei)
2. ✅ Removed template line from CLAUDE.md
3. ✅ Created ArcheryGame component with proper TypeScript types
4. ✅ Integrated game into main route (replaces demo content)
5. ✅ Started dev servers - frontend running on localhost:5173

## Next Steps
- Test game functionality in browser
- Identify potential improvements (scoring, sound effects, multiplayer features)
- Consider adding game state persistence with Convex

## Important Context
- This is archery game integration, not fresh template
- Need Three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei dependencies
- Game code provided is complete 3D implementation
