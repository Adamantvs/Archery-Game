# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Status
**Current Step**: Step 1 - Requirements Gathering (New Initialization)
**Starting Commit**: 9c8c551 (feat: integrate 3D archery game)

## Session Commits
- None yet

## Current Task
Initializing new application - gathering requirements from user about what they want to build.

## Progress
- Created todo list for initialization process
- Updated claude-notes.md (this file)
- User provided updated ArcheryGame.tsx with enhanced features
- Added enemy AI system - enemies wander around castle area
- Increased forest from 80 to 120 trees for denser environment
- Added sprint functionality (Hold Shift key for 2x movement speed)
- Added enemy collision detection and pop effects
- Next: Test implementation

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
