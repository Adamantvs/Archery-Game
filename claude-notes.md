- ✅ Fixed enemy regeneration system to properly respawn enemies after 10 seconds in valid locations
- ✅ Enhanced enemies with angry facial expressions (angled eyebrows, snarling mouths, 5 sharp fangs)
- ✅ Increased enemy movement speed from 1-2 to 3-5 units for more aggressive behavior
- ✅ Expanded wandering radius from 50x40 to 80x60 units for larger battlefield coverage
- ✅ Added 9 additional bomb crates (14 total) positioned closer to enemy patrol areas
- ✅ Implemented crate explosion damage system that kills enemies within 6-unit radius

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
