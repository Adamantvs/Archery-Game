# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Status
**Current Step**: Archery Game Enhancement
**Starting Commit**: e87469a (feat: enhance archery game with wandering enemies and sprint)

## Session Commits
- 2b16e98 feat: increase enemy wandering radius around castle
- 1608062 feat: fix collision detection, add crate regeneration, and redesign enemies
- c653b53 feat: fix enemy death explosions, add castle collision detection, and ensure proper regeneration

## Current Task
Completed multiple archery game enhancements and bug fixes.

## Progress
- ✅ Increased enemy wandering radius for more dynamic gameplay
- ✅ Fixed enemy collision detection issues with improved position tracking
- ✅ Added automatic crate regeneration after 15 seconds when destroyed
- ✅ Redesigned enemies as menacing demons with glowing red eyes, horns, fangs, and spiky armor
- ✅ Fixed enemy death explosions to appear at correct locations
- ✅ Added comprehensive castle wall collision detection preventing enemies from walking through structures
- ✅ Fixed enemy regeneration system to properly respawn enemies after 10 seconds in valid locations

## Important Context
- Template includes React + Vite + TanStack Router frontend with Convex backend and Clerk auth
- Current state has a 3D archery game integrated (from previous session)
- Need to understand if user wants to keep archery game or build something different
- Will need to remove demo content and implement MVP based on user requirements

## Previous Session Summary (Reference Only)
- Had integrated a 3D archery game with React Three Fiber
- Game features: crossbow shooting, bomb targets, explosions, medieval environment
- Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

## Next Steps
1. Ask user what they want to build
2. Get clarifying questions about core functionality and target users
3. Document responses and update CLAUDE.md
4. Plan and implement MVP

## Instructions for Future Sessions
If starting fresh, reread the project:init-app command contents in the command history to understand the initialization workflow.
